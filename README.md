# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project makes use of machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a Kaggle dataset. By addressing class imbalance and making use of various types of models, it achieves effective fraud detection

## Introduction
In a constantly evolving financial world, credit card fraud is a growing concern for banks who can face large financial losses at any given moment. Therefore it is essential that banks make use of machine learning in order to detect fraud as soon as it happens. In this project, I apply various machine learning techniques to adeptly identify fraudulent transactions. I explore preprocessing steps such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), scaling methods, handling imbalanced data and then implement various models such as Logistic Regression, LinearSVC and Random Forests to find the optimal precision/recall rates and f1 score

## Dataset
__Source:__ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data

__Content:__ The dataset contains 284,807 transactions from a two day period represented as numerical input variables which have undergone PCA transformation to preserve confidentiality. Of all transactions, 0.172% accounts for fraud or exactly 492 transactions
